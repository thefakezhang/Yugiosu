figure out how PMs work with banchoBot
hook the game API into the bot and test
add a phase between map picks to draw cards and ask what cards the players want to play
cards that are played should go into graveyard at the end of a map
add commands to view information (your cardlist, your hand and graveyard)
add in 1 card and try to get it working
from the sound of it, some cards are going to require the parsing of the matchlog for data we can't get through listeners alone
at the very end (if we somehow make it there) write a check for when bancho goes down
before a map is started, kick out all players not part of a team
CLEAN ALL PLAYER INPUTS!!!!!!!
perhaps all effects need to have some sort of priority timing? cards like ID-30 require some sort of specific timing to be written in



have all effects be accompanied with a single integer to denote the TURN timing of the effect (different from the micro timing BEFORE, AFTER, or THROUGHOUT)
